MyFC
====

A Corona SDK project submitted as part of an assignment for a Mobile Development module in the Digital Skills Academy's 'WebElevate' programme.

The 'MyFC' app allows football clubs to present a mini-Bio of all registered members for the current year.

'MyFC' has been written in Lua and developed using the Corona SDK.

Included here are all source files, a copy of the assignment brief and the MyFC.apk package which can be deployed on Android2.2+ (ARMv7) devices.

The MyFC.apk has only been tested on a Google Nexus 4 device.
